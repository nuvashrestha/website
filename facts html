                    <li>According to a study conducted in 2000, Todd et al. (10) discovered that despite having equal self-reports of pain, black patients were considerably less likely than white patients to get analgesics for extremities fractures in the emergency room (57% vs. 74%).</li>
                    <li>According to a study by Stato et al., patients were asked to report how much pain they were feeling and doctors were asked to rate how much pain they believed the patients were feeling. Compared to non-black patients (33.5%), doctors were more likely to underestimate the pain of black patients (47%) than of non-black patients.</li>
                    <li>According to a 2016 study by Hoffman et al., many white medical students mistakenly think black individuals have a better pain tolerance than white people. 73% of all participants held at least one position</li>

                    <li>According to a 2020 study, doctors admitted Black patients to hospitals 10% less frequently than white patients between 2005 and 2016. Additionally, data appears that Black persons had a 1.26 times higher mortality rate in hospitals and emergency rooms.</li>
